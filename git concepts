Git is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects. It is termed a distributed version control system because of its behaviour to allow multiple people to work on the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server.


Reason to Choose Git >>>

Distributed System: Every developer has a complete local copy of the project, allowing for offline work and increased resilience.
Performance: Git is fast and efficient, handling large projects with ease.
Branching and Merging: Git's lightweight branching and easy merging facilitate parallel development and feature isolation.
Collaboration: Tools like GitHub enhance team collaboration, code reviews, and project management.
Track Changes: Git tracks changes and maintains a history, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
